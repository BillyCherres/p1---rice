| **5 hour Challenge** | **Justification and Scrum Master Eval** |

| *Week 1*| Sean - Debug [Uno.java](https://github.com/sgtran/p1---rice/blob/main/src/ui/Uno.java) to be able to see the [Playfield.java](https://github.com/sgtran/p1---rice/blob/main/src/util/Playfield.java) in util as well as [Card.java](https://github.com/sgtran/p1---rice/blob/main/src/util/Card.java). Corrected source file settings in project settings and cleared the cache and restarting intellij. Critical Thinking(5) 5/5. I communicated my progress as well as assignments and deadlines to my team to make sure everyone is on the same page. Communication(5) 5/5. Collaborated with Kevin (pair share partner) and talked about how to implement our project into a website and talk to other teammates about roles Collaboration(5) 5/5. Created [GameSettings](https://github.com/sgtran/p1---rice/blob/main/src/ui/GameSettings.java) and created labels. Creativity and intangibles(5) 5/5.   |

|         | Alex - As per the scrum board, researched how online multiplayer games work, what information is most crucial to send to the servers, and how this information could be represented as numbers in a database (for example, Uno could have several server variables for each person such as turn number, number of cards, previous card number and previous card color). Critical Thinking 5/5. I researched on my assigned topic and is still continuing to research more about matchmaking and how they find an available player. Communication 4/5. Could have done better on communicating ideas with the team and maybe start putting down some points on the scrum board or project plan. Collaboration 5/5. Made sure that I understood the code so that I could collaborate better with people that had previously worked on this code and are much more familiar with it. Creativity 5/5. I am still planning to continue researching online multiplayer as it may be the biggest and most unfamiliar struggle we will run into this trimester.|
