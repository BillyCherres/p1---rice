| *Week 1*| Sean - Debug [Uno.java](https://github.com/sgtran/p1---rice/blob/main/src/ui/Uno.java) to be able to see the [Playfield.java](https://github.com/sgtran/p1---rice/blob/main/src/util/Playfield.java) in util as well as [Card.java](https://github.com/sgtran/p1---rice/blob/main/src/util/Card.java). Did this by setting the correct source file setting in project and then clearing the cache and restarting intellij. I was able to learn syntax quickly and contributed a large amount of code to the group.

I was always answering questions and clarifying project goals.
